# CSE485-ASU-Capstone-Showcase-Project

The project involves revitalizing the Arizona State University (ASU) website dedicated to showcasing capstone projects from the Computer Science 
and Electrical Engineering departments. It aims to bridge the gap between students' innovative work and the broader community, including potential 
employers, industry professionals, and academic peers. By integrating a seamless submission process through Google Forms, the project simplifies the 
inclusion of project details such as team names, sponsors, majors, and presentation links into the website. This initiative not only updates the site 
with current-year projects but also ensures the removal of outdated content, maintaining a fresh and engaging platform.

At its core, the project leverages PHP for website development and MySQL for database management, enabling automatic database updates or the creation 
of new tables based on the academic year of submission. This technical backbone supports a user-friendly interface that categorizes projects by major, 
enhancing navigability and relevance for visitors.

The update promises significant value to its primary customer archetype, the Aspiring Tech Innovator. This student seeks visibility for their capstone
project, opportunities to connect with industry leaders, and a platform that effectively communicates their project's value. By addressing these needs, 
the project not only showcases students' hard work but also opens doors to future career opportunities, making it a vital tool for professional development 
within the ASU community.

Sponsors, playing a crucial role in these projects, are also considered in the website's design and functionality. The project aims to highlight their 
contributions, facilitate engagement with the projects they support, and encourage future collaboration. Through targeted questions to sponsors, the project 
seeks to align with their expectations and enhance the overall impact of the capstone showcase.

In summary, this website update represents a strategic effort to enhance the visibility and impact of ASU's capstone projects, fostering a vibrant ecosystem of 
innovation, collaboration, and professional growth for students and sponsors alike.
